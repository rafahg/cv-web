                    <p class="lead mb-5">I am a Software Developer recently graduated from Makers Academy, a highly selective and intense Bootcamp in London.<br><br> I have previously worked as Bussines Manager and Lawyer in Spain.
                        After years working and developing my own business and legal practice, I felt the desire to work on something that has a stronger impact on the user's life.<br><br>I have always have the feeling that i love challenges and really get things done in a proper and effective way. I wanted to create products and deliver proffesional services that change people's lives, help them do their work, empower them providing better and more reliable services. <br><br>I have always been passionate about tech and knowing about things works from within. The way it is changing our lives really excites me so I started coding and immediately got a lot of satisfaction from it. All these factors convinced me that tech is the way to go to help people build a better world and so realise my wish.

                    <p>Life interest me as a whole, one of the reasons about pursuing this new career as a developer comes from my neverending curiosity, i can honestly say that almost any aspect of this life interest me, so what a better field to feed that curiosity than the Coding World!. A field, without exageration, which a person would need several lifes to know it all.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Having said that, time is finite, so eventhoug i am always trying to find time to many things, the ones i like the most are discovering new places, reading mistery novels, wikipedia binging sessions, watch Game of Thrones again an again, Stranger Things, travelling around the georgeous Britain contry side, and honestly, i would never say no to a pint with colleagues and friends.</p>
